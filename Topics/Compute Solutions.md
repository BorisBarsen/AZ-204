| Service                   | Suitable Scenarios                                                          | Distinctive Features                                                                                  | Specific Criteria                                   |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Azure Container Apps      | Building serverless microservices based on containers                       | General-purpose containers, Kubernetes-style apps, event-driven architectures, long-running processes | No need for direct access to native Kubernetes APIs |
| Azure App Service         | Fully managed hosting for web applications, including websites and web APIs | Optimized for web applications, integrated with other Azure services                                  |                                                     |
| Azure Container Instances | Lower-level "building block" option compared to Container Apps              | No scale, load balancing, and certificates                                                            | Less "opinionated" building block                   |
| Azure Kubernetes Service  | Fully managed Kubernetes option in Azure                                    | Direct access to the Kubernetes API, runs any Kubernetes workload                                     |                                                     |
| Azure Functions           | Running event-driven applications using the functions programming model     | Short-lived functions deployed as either code or containers                                           |                                                     |

- **Azure Container Apps** vs. **AKS**: If you require access to the Kubernetes APIs and control plane, use AKS. If you want to build Kubernetes-style applications without needing direct access to all native Kubernetes APIs, Container Apps is preferable.
- **Azure Container Instances** vs. **Container Apps**: ACI is a more basic building block without application-specific concepts like scale and load balancing, while Container Apps provides these features.
- **Azure Functions** vs. **Container Apps**: Both are suitable for event-driven applications, but Functions is optimized for short-lived functions, while Container Apps is more general-purpose.
