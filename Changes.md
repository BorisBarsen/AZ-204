# Changes

From the changelog, the major changes in the AZ-204 exam after April 28, 2023, are as follows:

1. **Implement IaaS solutions** has been changed to **Implement containerized solutions**. This is a major change, and it may involve a significant shift in the syllabus to container technology like Docker, Kubernetes, Azure Container Instances, and Azure Kubernetes Service.

2. **Implement Azure Functions** has been marked as a major change. This might mean that there could be more in-depth topics and focus on Azure Functions in the exam.

3. **Develop solutions that use Cosmos DB storage** has been changed to **Develop solutions that use Azure Cosmos DB**. This is a major change, and it suggests that there might be more emphasis on Azure Cosmos DB specific features and capabilities.

4. **Develop solutions that use blob storage** has been changed to **Develop solutions that use Azure Blob Storage**. This also represents a major change, indicating a more focused study on Azure Blob Storage.

The rest of the areas have minor changes or no changes, suggesting that they might have slight modifications or updates in line with the current Azure services.

From the study guide, there are more specific topics listed under each area. For example, under "Implement containerized solutions," it is now necessary to study "Create and manage container images for solutions," "Publish an image to Azure Container Registry," "Run containers by using Azure Container Instance," and "Create solutions by using Azure Container Apps." These topics provide more granular details for your study and preparation for the exam.
