## Breadcrumb trail

If question requires to figure out the order of commands, look for hints in code: for example Step X is using a variable initialized in Step Y, it means the order is Y, X.

## Learn your craft

You should be able to not only learn commands, but also explain them - what they do, what they require. Example: To mount an Azure File Share to an Azure Container Instance, you need the Storage Account Key.

## Powershell

All commands use `AZ<COMMAND>` format, not `Azure<COMMAND>`. Examples: `New-AzKeyVault`, `Add-AzKeyVaultCertificate`. Usually create operations are `New-Az<Service>`, update operations are `Set-Az<Service>`.

## Save for later

All questions you have doubts on, **mark them for review** as you can't go back to them if you don't. **If you go to the bathroom / take a break, you cannot go back to previous questions!!!**
