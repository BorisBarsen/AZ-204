# Notes

## Breadcrumb trail

If question requires to figure out the order of commands, look for hints in code: for example Step X is using a variable initialized in Step Y, it means the order is Y, X.

## Powershell

All commands use `AZ<COMMAND>` format, not `Azure<COMMAND>`. Examples: `New-AzKeyVault`, `Add-AzKeyVaultCertificate`.

## Deny everything

**USE THIS ONLY IF YOU TOTALLY DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER!!!** If the question is one of these that doesn't allow you to go back, and if you have to figure out if something satisfies given requirenments, say "No" to everything. **YOU ARE GUARANTEED TO HAVE AT LEAST ONE QUESTION WRONG!!!** **THERE ARE VALID CASES WHERE ALL THE SOLUTIONS ARE RIGHT!!!** (like which tools can be used to move blobs) **YOU ARE TAKING A HUGE GAMBLE WITH THIS!!!** Not valid strategy if all the options are on a single page.
