# Notes

## Breadcrumb trail

If question requires to figure out the order of commands, look for hints in code: for example Step X is using a variable initialized in Step Y, it means the order is Y, X.

## Powershell

All commands use `AZ<COMMAND>` format, not `Azure<COMMAND>`. Examples: `New-AzKeyVault`, `Add-AzKeyVaultCertificate`.

## Save for later

All questions you have doubts on, **mark them for review** as you can't go back to them if you don't.
